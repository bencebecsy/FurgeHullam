# Quick-start Guide to FurgeHullam

## Setup
Once we have a conda environment with `enterprise` and `enterprise_extensions` installed, `FurgeHullam` can be locally pip installed. Below is a potential setup from scratch.

Create new `conda` environment:
```
conda create --name FurgeHullam python=3.9
```
Active our new environment:
```
conda activate FurgeHullam
```
Install `enterprise_extensions` via `conda-forge`, which also installs `enterprise` as a requirement:
```
conda install -c conda-forge enterprise_extensions
```
Pip install `FurgeHullam` via `git`:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/bencebecsy/FurgeHullam.git
```
